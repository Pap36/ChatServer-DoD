# ChatServer-DoD

Implementation of a Chat Server in Java using threads. 

# Main functionalities: 
- real time messaging between users
- very simplistic Bot which broadcasts a sample message to all users
- users can locally play Dungeons of Doom, a turn based command line game

# How to run the server:
 1. After compiling all files, run "java ChatServer" to start the server
 2. To connect as a user, run "java ChatClient"
 3. To connect the bot to the chat, run "java ChatBot"
 
# In chat commands:
- type "hey Quacky" to recieve the sample message from the bot
- type "/disconnect" to disconnect from the server
- type "/play DoD" to play the game locally

To close the server, type "EXIT" in the server's terminal.
